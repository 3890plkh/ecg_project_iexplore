# ECG Project (Imperial I-Explore)

This is the project code for analysis of ECG data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (can be found here: https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/). 
This repository contains the following code:
* downloadall.py - converts each 30 minute ECG signal in the database into a .csv file. 
* snippets.py - creates snippets of ECG pulses of different types of heart conditions. Heart condition is determined is from the annotations provided in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
* ecgcode.py - for playing around with the data, contains a function called plotCondition(), which plots a section of a snippet for a specific heart condition that you specify.

## What the Aims of the Project are

The potential aims of the project are to:
- do some basic ECG analysis (e.g. heart rate)
- train an ML model to detect heart defects from ECG data

## Prerequisites

You will need to download the wdfb Python package to be able to deal with the format the ECG signals are stored in [1][2]. Also we are currently intending on using the multi-layered perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model from the python module scikit-learn for classification of ECG signal [3]. To install both, run the command: 
```
pip install wfdb
pip install scikit-learn
```
in your terminal.

Documentation for wfdb module is available here: https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
Documentation for the MLPNN model is available here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html#multi-layer-perceptron

Will also need the standard Python data processing libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib etc.). If you do not have these installed just run the above command but with whatever module you need to install.
