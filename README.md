# ECG Project (Imperial I-Explore)

This is the project code for analysis of ECG data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (can be found here: https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/). To read the data you will need to run the downloadall.py script which converts all of the data into a .csv format.

## What the Aims of the Project are

The potential aims of the project are to:
- do some basic ECG analysis (e.g. heart rate)
- train an ML model to detect heart defects from ECG data

## Prerequisites

You will need to download the wdfb Python package. To install, run the command: 
```
pip install wfdb
```
in your terminal 

Documentation is available here: https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Will also need the standard Python data processing libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib etc.). If you do not have these installed just run the above command but with whatever module you need to install.
