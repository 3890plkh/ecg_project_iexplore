# ECG Project (Imperial I-Explore)

This is the project code for analysis of ECG data from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (can be found here: https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/). 

This repository contains the following code:
* snippets.py - creates snippets of ECG pulses of different types of heart conditions. Heart condition is determined is from the annotations provided in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
* ecgcode.py - for playing around with the data, contains a function called plotCondition(), which plots a section of a snippet for a specific heart condition that you specify.
* trainingDataSelector.py - contains a function that selects a percentage of the data to be used to train the MLPNN model. Which files make up that percentage is randomised each time (i.e. if you want 80% of the data to be used as training data, 80% of the total snippets will get selected each time, but out of our total snippets, which files make up this 80% changes each time)
* mplnn_test0.py - first attempt at creating a working ML model. The ECG signals are fed in as a Fourier transforms. You can specify what percentage of the data should be used for training the ML model from the command line (if you don't specify a percentage, 80% of the data will be used for training as default).
* test_all_models.py - trains all models using the same data and calculate an accuracy for each model. The code can create multiple training datasets and train all models on each of these datasets, and calculate an accuracy for each dataset. Plots a histogram of the accuracy scores.

## What the Aims of the Project are

The potential aims of the project are to:
- do some basic ECG analysis (e.g. heart rate)
- train an ML model to detect heart defects from ECG data

## Prerequisites

You will need to download the wdfb Python package to be able to deal with the format the ECG signals are stored in [1][2]. Also we are currently intending on using the multi-layered perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model from the python module scikit-learn for classification of ECG signals [3]. To install both modules, run the command: 
```
pip install wfdb scikit-learn
```
in your terminal.

Documentation for wfdb module is available here: https://wfdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Documentation for the MLPNN model is available here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html#multi-layer-perceptron

Will also need the standard Python data processing libraries (numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib etc.). If you do not have these installed just run the above command but with whatever module you need to install.

## Running the Code
You just need to run the mlpnn_test0.py or the test_all_models.py script, it should run all of the prerequisites for you.

You are able to input command line arguments for both scripts.

For mlpnn_test0.py, after the script name, you are able to specify the command line arguments:
```
percentage mode model_type
```
percentage specifies the % of data to be used for training the model, please type in "FT" for the mode argument and model_type specifies which model is to be used. You can see all of the possible options for the ML models in the code. Default parameters are 80 FT MLP.

For test_all_models.py, after the script name, you are able to specify the command line arguments :
```
percentage mode iterations
```
percentage specifies the % of data to be used for training the model, type in "FT" for the mode argument and iterations specifies which how many random datasets are generated. Default parameters are 80 FT 1.
